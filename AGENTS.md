# Agent guide to Virgil

Virgil is a browser-based visual LaTeX editor for academic writing, designed to cowork with AI agents. It runs fully client-side (File System Access API for disk, IndexedDB for prefs), doesn't compile LaTeX, and renders `.tex` meaningfully while preserving the source. Agents interact with the user's paper by reading the same `.tex`/`.bib` files and writing JSON sidecars into the paper's `virgil/` folder.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Codebase guide

Deeper docs in `docs/agents/`. Load them on demand when their topic comes up — they aren't auto-transcluded, so this index stays lean:

- **[docs/agents/overview.md](docs/agents/overview.md)** — What Virgil is, tech stack, `src/` map, core concepts. Read first in a new session.
- **[docs/agents/glossary.md](docs/agents/glossary.md)** — User terminology → code names + file paths. Consult whenever the user uses a term (panel, Virgil bar, marginalia, jump-to button, can-I-request button, etc.) you don't recognize.
- **[docs/agents/ui-chrome.md](docs/agents/ui-chrome.md)** — Panels, tool strips, MenuBar (aka Virgil bar), actions/formatting toolbars, floating panels and cards.
- **[docs/agents/main-text.md](docs/agents/main-text.md)** — TipTap editor, block/inline nodes, paragraph UUIDs, link architecture, marginalia, citations, LaTeX round-trip.
- **[docs/agents/architecture.md](docs/agents/architecture.md)** — Registries, key hooks, persistence, sidecars, drag/drop MIME map, per-panel overrides.

## Glossary protocol

If the user uses a term that doesn't resolve cleanly to a code name, append it to the **Pending terminology** section at the bottom of `docs/agents/glossary.md` with your best-guess code referent and today's date. The cleanup skill consolidates these on the next merge cycle.

Each sub-doc begins with `<!-- last-verified: <sha> <date> -->`. If the hash is far behind `HEAD` and something feels stale, verify against the current code before relying on the doc.

## Style

[src/STYLE_GUIDE.md](src/STYLE_GUIDE.md) is the design-system reference. Check it before building new UI. Update it when a UI decision feels generalizable.
